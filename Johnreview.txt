John has come a long way since mid year. His ability to listen to feedback and act upon it is 
really good. His drive to make progress and increase h
is area of responsibility is a positive as 
well. He is collaborative and communicates with the team as needed. A few areas he needs to 
work on next year would be working more towards leading projects and making sure timelines 
are met. Taking initiative in 
making sure we are following the roadmap and meeting the 
milestones. Managing the trello and holding team responsible for the deliverables. I would also 
like to see John be a bit more pro
-
active in bringing up issues, constraints and opportunities 
rather t
han his manager having to administer or initiate the conversation. John will also benefit 
from doing some training around team management now that he has people directly reporting to 
him.
 
John possesses a strong drive to do well within the organization. He
 
takes initiative to get things 
moving and delivered on time. He tries to share his insight proactively, positively and works for 
the betterment of the team. He exhibits a good upside to eventually do more within the company. 
He has played a critical role 
in the success and development of the product. He is a champion for 
customers input and needs. He has taken that viewpoint to help drive innovation within the 
product. What John needs to work on is being less tactical and more strategic in his day to day. 
John is quick to jump in and fix things which sometimes works against helping find out root 
cause as well as holding the team accountable. John needs to work on elevating his ability to 
delegate and push responsibility where it needs to be to allow himself
 
to continue his 
development and others to realize their responsibility.
 
 
Over the next 4 months, I would like to 
challenge John to leverage his strategic position and outlook to anchor the whole team and 
execute on the product concept. Through his collabo
ration, I would like John to help to impart 
accountability and collaboration to the extended team to achieve results in a timely manner
 
John showed good initiative with taking over and delivering the product in time. He was able to 
manage the tight timelin
es and work with the client to get the job done. Although the work was 
delivered in time there were a few misses that John needs to make sure are taken care of in the 
future. He needs to make sure he is communicating effectively with all the members of the
 
team. 
There were instances where I was not in the loop and had to get up to speed only after the 
discussion was done with other team members or client. Team members outside of the core 
product team struggled with understanding the deliverable and how they
 
could collaborate and 
be able to contribute. For scaling a solution John would need to make sure he is following the 
processes, using the resources efficiently and making sure everyone involved is up to speed on 
status/progress. Although, John tends to hi
t his product deadlines but other responsibilities he has 
as a manager and leader in the company usually get delayed and need multiple reminders. 
Figuring out how to draw a balance between various responsibilities and be able to prioritize at 
the right tim
e. Collaborating with his peers and subordinates more will be key to success next 
year. Being able to trust and learn to delegate and follow
-
up will definitely benefit. Overall, John 
has a lot of potential and can make significant strides provided he recog
nizes his pitfalls and 
works on them
 
John overall has embraced the recent changes that happened in the org recently. He demonstrated 
much adaptability by taking over new responsibilities and incorporating feedback to produce the 
desired deliverables. John 
took a significant amount of responsibilities from what He initially 
had to enable the agile structure and support the product teams. He has come a long way since 
He started. I do see improvements in his meeting management and collaboration with the teams.
 
I also feel he is aware of his shortcomings from a skill set perspective. John still has a long way 
ahead of him to accomplish his goals in his current role. He needs to polish up his leadership 
skills and gain depth in his current role to come off as an 
authority. Collaborating more with the 
product teams and working towards being their ally will help him be more successful as a scrum 
master. There is still a need to figure out how to juggle multiple priorities and make sure teams 
adhere to the process to
 
minimize the rework or impact on the overall deliverables. I would also 
like John to be a bit more proactive and start working in an advisory capacity and be a thought 
leader. Thinking outside of the box as well as identifying issues proactively is requir
ed. He needs 
to have a good view and hold on to how the product strategy is emerging to enable logical 
discussions and be able to provide direction in terms of process and governance.
 
Johns planning shows that he is 
 
very hardworking, positive, supportive,
 
and organized to help 
design the plan
 
The overall plan for the launch was delayed and was not clearly shared in the weekly updates. 
Moving forward we need to capture and risk, speak to that and accurately plan for unforeseen 
issues that arise.
 
The goal of
 
closing the 2 new deals in Q1 went off without a hitch, was delivered on time and 
the appropriate integration planning was delivered flawlessly
 
As part of the plan, we were to close on both new targets in Q1 and have the roadmap for closure 
identified. While we are on our way to doing both we missed our goal and still need a framework 
as to when we will get there
 
John, you exceeded your production goal by 20%
 

help us meet our overall plant producti

 
John
-
 
your style of leadership has been noted by many of your peers as being adaptable, genuine 
and caring. I have heard from more than one person about you can do attitude to support 
everyone not matter the situ

team meetings

track I have to rely on you guys to understand each other's concerns. Please ensure yo
u are 
updating the workstream and the process is being adapted on time
 
 
Coming in under payroll and delivering the reports to the bank early every week without fail is 
an amazing accomplishment that helps drive such positivity throughout the organizations
 
Your inconsistency in delivery consistent payroll number as well as being on time each week 
puts the organization is a state of unrest and makes week to week more challenging than it 
should be
 
The new code deployment really enables the site to drive report
ing to no longer need to be on

demand but the much

anticipated push to you every morning. This is a phenomenal 
accomplishment and your hard work is noted
 
The lack of automation in your latest reporting updates is not up to expectations. As previously 
discu
ssed, automation of some sort was to happen in this release cycle. It was never told that it 
would not happen and there needs to be a clear path to achieve this, on time, as expected
 
John really took control of the marketing roadmap. It was obvious things 
were going awry with 
the original production schedule, but because he stepped in and got everybody back on track and 
redesigned the tracker we were able to walk away accomplishing all of the items on the agenda.

help us meet our overall plant producti

 
John

your style of leadership has been noted by many of your peers as being adaptable, genuine 
and caring. I have heard from more than one person about you can do attitude to support 
everyone not matter the situ
ation
 

the same. However, I noticed that you tend to remain silent most of the times even during your
 
team meetings

vation of mine and would really like 

 
John Effectively solves problems rather than symptoms
 
John puts a plan into an efficient and direct process that enables his business unit to run smoothly
 


workstream. Well, keeping things is comparatively easier but for keeping everyone on the same 
track I have to rely on you guys to understand each other's concerns. Please ensure yo
u are 
updating the workstream and the process is being adapted on time
 
 
Coming in under payroll and delivering the reports to the bank early every week without fail is 
an amazing accomplishment that helps drive such positivity throughout the organizations
 
Your inconsistency in delivery consistent payroll number as well as being on time each week 
puts the organization is a state of unrest and makes week to week more challenging than it 
should be
 
The new code deployment really enables the site to drive report
ing to no longer need to be on
-
demand but the much
-
anticipated push to you every morning. This is a phenomenal 
accomplishment and your hard work is noted
 
The lack of automation in your latest reporting updates is not up to expectations. As previously 
discu
ssed, automation of some sort was to happen in this release cycle. It was never told that it 
would not happen and there needs to be a clear path to achieve this, on time, as expected
 
John really took control of the marketing roadmap. It was obvious things 
were going awry with 
the original production schedule, but because he stepped in and got everybody back on track and 
redesigned the tracker we were able to walk away accomplishing all of the items on the agenda.

My expectation was that you would prov
ide us with more details on the marketing 
roadmap.
 
 

decisions until later this week.
 
 
What can you do to ensure that we will have the correct 

 
 
John effectively laun
ched the go
-
to
-
market campaign with Atlas PR on time, under budget and 
with a strong response rate in the first week from external views to the link on social and own 
website. It far exceeded expectations
 
John was tasked with launching the go
-
to
-
market cam
paign within 30 days with Atlas PR and the 
campaign ultimately took 45 days to launch. The launch period delay negatively impacts 
maximum exposure rate to own site and social however the overall launch did go smoothly and 
was received well. John needs to p
lan to time better and understand that a great launch can 
maximize results
